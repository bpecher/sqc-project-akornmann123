### Database Use ######
> First table I will be creating is the "karts" table. This will keep 
> track of all the karts. Branching from the karts table will be "gliders"
> and "wheels". These tables are what you can pick to put on your kart. Those
> two tables will keep track of all the gliders and all the wheels.
> I will have a "characters" table which will keep track of the characters.
> Lastly, I will have a "maps" table that will keep track of all the maps
> they can race on.
